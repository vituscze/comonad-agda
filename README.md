Comonads (not only) for programmers
===================================

This is part of my bachelor's work about comonads and derivation (or rather partial differentiation) of data types.

Content
-------

The code presents two main ways in which comonads are usually defined and shows that these two presentations are indeed equivalent. Various data types for which the comonad operations can be defined are also shown, together with machine-checked proof that these operations satisfy all comonad laws.

TODO: Add description of the module structure.
